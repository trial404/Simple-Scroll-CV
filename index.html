            <h3>Hi, Hello, Buenos Dias.</h3>
            <p>Life is an adventure in lived and learned experience. Sometimes the lessons we learn are not the ones we want to,
              but come as the opportunity presents itself. For the past year, happiness and self-fulfilment have been ideas seemingly out of reach.
              The situations life presents can be complicated, and some ideas may seem miles and mountains away, but like any good adventure, the hardest
              part is often starting. This is my first website. Its the start of something more. Its but a step on the journey to the next summit.</p>

                <h3>Setting Goals</h3>
                <p class="p-left">I’m an avid hiker and outdoorsman and one of the things that has always been apparent when climbing mountains, is sometimes it takes
                  climbing one mountain before you know which you’ll climb next. Its one thing to see names on a map, but another to see a peak looming
                  in the distance. This concept carries over into other aspects of life, for example my career; I have never had an issues focusing on
                  things I’m interested in, but knowing what I want to do and what career path to follow is one that’s plagued me. In a way, its not been
                  so much a problem in knowing what I should do, but rather what I can do. The problem can in part be attributed to lack of exposure to
                  the possibilities. Much like seeing a new peak from the one you’ve just climbed, seeing the career you want is sometimes only possible
                  while doing something else. But this leads to the next problem, seeing what your goal is not the same as achieving your goal.</p>

              <h3>Learned Examples</h3>
              <p class="p-right">Photography is something that I was came to love late in life (relatively speaking). I’ve always loved to see how lighting changed a
                subject or how a the colours of a landscape change over the day. Growing up in the mountains, I came to realize it can be hard to truly
                describe the things I was getting to see with words, I need imagery. A visual outlet. Photography was something I gravitated to. It drew
                me in, much like the landscapes and sunsets painted in my head. But it was not something taught to me. Learning to take pictures and
                specifically the pictures that capture things as I see them, has been a journey in itself. I saw things I wanted to do and took the
                steps to learn how to do them. I started with the idea and momentum of desire carried me to learning them. The struggles weren’t
                struggles but rather fun learning experiences. There was no consequence in failing, just progression. This is the idealic example of
                learning, but as I would I’ve come to discover, is not always the case. </p>

              <h3>Trying and Failing</h3>
              <p class="p-left">Living in Vancouver, I was exposed to other languages, but since English is the dominant language, there was never a need to speak
                another. It wasn’t until I had the opportunity to live and travel a little and was exposed to people living in other countries amd
                communicating in 3, 4 or 5 different languages, that the beauty and allure of having this ability really became apparent to me.
                Learning languages in school was always a means to and end; I studied to pass a class or to get a grade, but there was no utility in
                the learning. Living the example of not being able to communicate showed me this power of communication. I became enamored with the
                idea of speaking another language. To be able to understand and communicate in something that to me was completely foreign and
                unintelligible became my goal. I tried and failed many times to learn on my own. It became an exercise in starts, telling myself
                that with each new avenue of learning I took, the last was the reason I couldn’t do it. It wasn’t me, it was the method - I just
                wasn’t doing it right or hadn’t found that easy way that worked for me. It wasn’t until I started learning to code that I realized
                what my real issue was. I wasn’t giving myself the opportunity to succeed. Sometimes there is no shortcut to success. Sometimes it
                takes repetition, daily practice, long-term commitment. Watching youtube videos of people learning a language in a 48hours or a week
                painted lead me down a path that only ended in self-doubt and disappointment. This may be the reality for some, but certainly not
                most. Much like saving up for your retirement, you don’t make your entire life savings in one weeks, you accumulate and rely on the
                compounding interest over time to earn and save. Learning a language proved to be much like this. I decided to focus on learning
                pathway: Duolingo. I did it everyday. Sometimes just 15 minutes and sometimes just an hour, but eventually I began to hear the words
                in the Spanish songs I listened to, to understand the tv shows I was watching (albeit with Spanish subtitles), to truly start being able
                to learn from multiple sources. Compound interest of learning everyday was starting to pay off. I am by no means fluent, but its apparent
                that I’m miles from where I started. I can convey my thoughts, I can have a conversation. For me, this foreign and unintelligible language
                suddenly seemed within reach. This experience opened my eyes to what was possible. What I could learn given the time and the will.</p>

              <h3>Whats next !?</h3>
              <p class="p-right">Coding has always been something I enjoyed but never had the time to fully invest in. When I was studying
                 engineering, it was a class that came naturally, but as I struggled with other courses, it wasn’t one I could really focus.
                  My engineering degree felt like a fire fight of focusing on the most urgent. Everything felt hard and with a big course load,
                  I ended up being stretched to focus on passing the courses I was bad at and letting the ones I was better at go by.
                  Unfortunately, this isn’t a good way to develop and cultivate interests. After making some changes in my life, I’m
                  freed up the time and mental space to see if its for me. My hope is to apply the same lessons I learned through photography
                  and language learning to take on the challenges of learning yet another new skill. This site is a testament to the fact
                  that I can take the first step. The ones to follow will determine if I can follow through.</p>
